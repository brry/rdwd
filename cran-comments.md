On some test platforms I see installed size is 5.4 Mb.
This stems from the DWD (german weather service) expanding the available datasets yet again.
The issue is known but could not be resolved in this CRAN release.

I hope to find a solution by the next release and would greatly appreciate if you could accept it this time.
