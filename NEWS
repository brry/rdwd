rdwd ToDo-list / wishlist / issues
- readDWD.data: figure out reason for fread trouble (reported in emails by some users)
- selectDWD("Berlin", res="monthly", var="kl", per="h", exactmatch = F) should only return stations with data, with a single warning only
- dataDWD: should dbin default be TRUE?
- use terra (in addition to / instead of raster) where possible

Version 1.1.0 (2019-05-30)
Highlights:
- Binary Radolan data can now be read correctly
- The new FTP server is used
- Raster data can easily be projected
- All readDWD subfunctions now have their own documentation

Important changes:
- dataDWD arguments to readDWD removed (can be passed with ...)
- dataDWD gains joinbf argument to join base and relative url path
- readDWD can expand DWD abbreviations in column names (varnames=TRUE)
- readDWD source code structure is improved.
- readDWD.multia ignores EndOfFile characters in multiannual data on Unix
- readDWD.raster accepts gunzip arguments, reads faster on second calls
- readDWD.data informatively handles empty files
- readDWD.binary+raster+asc overlay Germany maps in example plots
- readDWD.binary unzips into a given exdir (and reads faster on second calls)
- readDWD.binary transforms output to a raster stack
- selectDWD suggests only available data in interactive option
- selectDWD and nearbyStations fail informatively for typical errors
- fileIndex loses the unnnecessary leading slashes
- indexFTP uses tree of files at new FTP server

New user-visible functions + objects: 
- newColumnNames
- dwdparams (renamed from parameter_abreviations)
- gridbase
- gridIndex
- projectRasterDWD
- localtestdir (though mainly for internal usage)

New unexported functions:
- readDWD.asc
- readRadarfile + bin2num + FORTRAN code
- checkIndex


-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 1.0.0 (2019-03-17)
First major version increase!
Tests are now systematic and comprehensive (albeit run locally and manually to reduce CRAN load and enable local file writing).
selectDWD got a very noticable performance boost and an interactive res/var/per selection.
Handling raster files is now supported in rdwd.
Examples and vignettes have been refined.
Detailed changes can be found on https://github.com/brry/rdwd/commits, here's the main overview:

- dataDWD: dots now passed to readDWD, download errors checked and returned as informative warning
- readDWD: reading functions added for binary, raster and multi_annual files, MESS_DATUM POSIXct column added in monthly data, list output now named
- indexFTP: now removes duplicates from file list, sped up in default 1min/prec usage
- rdwd now works fine with multi_annual and subdaily data
- readVars: parameter abbreviations completed, output now visible
- selectDWD: order of arguments changed, interactive res/var/per selection enabled, computing speed extremely increased
- localtests.R heavily expanded, examples reduced and refined
- indexes + vignettes updated, use cases expanded with nearbyStations example
New functions and objects: readMeta, dwdbase (central package base url)


-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.11.0 (2018-11-26)
- dataDWD: argument force can now be NA to download files older than 24 hours
- hourly/solar timestamp now processed automatically
- use cases vignette added
- vignettes precompiled + CRAN tests removed to reduce automated load on DWD Server
- indexFTP: got much smarter in discerning files from folders
- indexes expanded for new DWD data
New function: readVars, along with parameter_abreviations

-----------------------------
-----------------------------

Version 0.10.0 (2018-03-26)
- created new index with sub-hourly data, reflected in data overview at selectDWD
- dataDWD,readDWD,selectDWD: file ending checks more elegant

-----------------------------
-----------------------------


Version 0.6.1 (2017-01-24)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2017-01-24}

'selectDWD' uses index information to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.
'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
'createIndex' uses that list to create 'fileIndex', 'metaIndex' and 'geoIndex'.
'mapDWD' is an interactive leaflet map also useful to explore datasets.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
