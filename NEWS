rdwd ToDo-list / wishlist / issues
- dataDWD: potentially use curl to download data without sleep need
- readDWD: figure out reason for fread trouble (reported in emails by some users)
- readRadarFile: check with RX file, see if NA assignment is redundant
- readDWD.raster project example correctly

rdwd Version history

Version 1.0.0 (2019-03-17)
First major version increase!
Tests are now systematic and comprehensive (albeit run locally and manually to reduce CRAN load and enable local file writing).
selectDWD got a very noticable performance boost and an interactive res/var/per selection.

Version 0.6.1 (2017-01-24)
Initial release of the package, development can be seen at
https://github.com/brry/rdwd/compare/master@{2016-10-19}...master@{2017-01-24}

'selectDWD' uses index information to find files matching a path or station criteria.
With the returned path/file names, 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' download and read data.
'dirDWD' and 'fileDWD' control that no file will be overwritten and path messages are useful.
'indexDWD' lists all the files on the FTP server with DWD data.
'createIndex' uses that list to create 'fileIndex', 'metaIndex' and 'geoIndex'.
'mapDWD' is an interactive leaflet map also useful to explore datasets.

Note: 'dataDWD' and 'readDWD' were started in June 2016 within my misc package
berryFunctions, from which they will be deleted after rdwd is on CRAN
